This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(GOSemSim)
d <- godata('org.Hs.eg.db', ont="CC", computeIC=FALSE)

# TODO other Ont terms: MF, biological processes, similar component
# TODO other methods for measure="Wang"

# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")
```
```{r}
expData <- read.csv(file = 'testingEntrezData.csv')
head(expData)

grounds = c()
rands = c()

nrows = nrow(expData)

print(nrows)
# For some reason there are a bunch of warnings when runnning clusterSim
pb = txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = length(nrows), initial = 0) 

suppressWarnings( 
  for (row in 1:nrows) {
    setTxtProgressBar(pb,row)
    a <- strsplit(expData[row,2],';')
    a1 <- strsplit(expData[row,3],';')
    b <- strsplit(expData[row,4],';')
  
    groundSim = clusterSim(a, a1, semData=d, measure="Wang")
    randSim = clusterSim(b, a1, semData=d, measure="Wang")
  
    grounds = c(grounds,groundSim)
    rands = c(rands,randSim)
    if(row%%500 == 0){
      print(row)
    }
  }
)

```

```{r}
hist(grounds)
hist(rands)

correct = grounds > rands
print(length(correct[correct == TRUE]))
print(sum(grounds>rands))


write.csv(grounds, file ="grounds_experiment1CC.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(rands, file ="rands_experiment1CC.csv", row.names=FALSE)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
